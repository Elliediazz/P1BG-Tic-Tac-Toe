# P1BG-Tic-Tac-Toe

Objective
My P1BG project consisted of using Javascript, CSS, and HTML to develop a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This game consists of two players playing against each other, no AI is used in this game. Below is a description of the game to allows players to better understand the game. 

GAME DESCRIPTION:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played by two players, on a 3x3 board. The players then choose whether they want too be an 'X' or an 'O', in this game the player to begin the game is 'X'. From there the players take turns placing marks on the board and aim to make three consecutive marks wither horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first player to reach three consecutive marks wins!
